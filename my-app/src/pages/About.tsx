            <p>Hi! I love creating fast, elegant, and efficient solutions
                to tough problems. I'm currently a CS major at Rice University, 
                and I'm mainly interested in backend and systems
                programming right now. When I'm not coding, I'm usually noodling
                around on my electric guitar.
